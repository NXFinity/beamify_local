# Introduction

The Beamify Role System provides a flexible and secure way to manage user access and capabilities throughout the platform. Roles are collections of permissions that define what actions a user can perform on various resources. By assigning roles to users, administrators can efficiently control access at scale.

## What is a Role?
A role is a named set of permissions. Each permission grants the ability to perform a specific action (such as 'manage', 'view', or 'edit') on a particular resource (such as 'users', 'roles', or 'audit_logs').

## Why Use Roles?
- **Simplified Access Management:** Assigning roles to users is easier and less error-prone than managing individual permissions for each user.
- **Scalability:** As your team or user base grows, roles make it easy to onboard, offboard, or change access for groups of users.
- **Security:** Roles help enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have the access they need.

## How Roles Work in Beamify
- Roles are created and managed by administrators.
- Each role has a unique name, an optional description, and a set of permissions.
- Users can have one or more roles.
- Permissions can also be assigned directly to users for special cases, but roles are the primary mechanism for access control.

## Example Roles
- **SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR:** Full access to all admin features.
- **MEMBER:** Basic access, such as viewing and editing their own profile.
- **MODERATOR:** Custom roles can be created for specific needs (e.g., managing users, viewing audit logs).

See the following documentation for details on managing roles, assigning roles to users, and best practices.
