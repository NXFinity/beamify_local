# Introduction

The User API in Beamify Server provides endpoints for managing user accounts and profiles. It supports standard CRUD operations, profile retrieval, updates, and account deletion. These endpoints are designed for both users and administrators to interact with user data in a secure and structured way.

**Key features include:**
- Retrieve all users (public, only non-sensitive data)
- Get a user by ID
- Get the current authenticated user's profile
- Update user information
- Delete a user account

Each endpoint is documented in detail in this section, including request/response formats and usage examples.
